GemGIS is a Python-based, open-source geographic information processing library.
It is capable of preprocessing spatial data such as vector data (shape files, geojson files, geopackages),
raster data, data obtained from WMS services or XML/KML files.
Preprocessed data can be stored in a dedicated Data Class to be passed to the geomodeling package GemPy
in order to accelerate to model building process.
