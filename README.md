Geographic information processing for geomodeling

**Current developments are taking place https://github.com/cgre-aachen/gemgis/tree/development_gemgis_alex_juestel and will be merged into the master soon**

## Purpose

Joint methods for processing of GIS data sets for use in geological modeling packages. Here as a separate repo to get started, also because methods may become useful for gempy, gempy-explicit, pynoddy... let's see.
