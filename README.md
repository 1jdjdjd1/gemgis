# gemgis
Geographic information processing for geomodeling

## Purpose

Joint methods for processing of GIS data sets for use in geological modeling packages. Here as a separate repo to get started, also because methods may become useful for gempy, gempy-explicit, pynoddy... let's see.

## Access

Private, so far (as we have this option now in github). Will be opened if we know a bit in which direction it is going.
